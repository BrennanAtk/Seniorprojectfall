Capstone proseminar project on AI's integration into cyber security

I want to explore Artificial intelligence’s implementation into the cyber security space. I want to know what’s trusted, what’s safeguarded, and what is being automated with the use of AI. I want to know if this space is being open minded to things like “AI Agents” and if this space will always be dependent on human oversight. I want to look at data and find where its working effectevly, in what spaces, and where there is a middle ground between AI tools and Human analysts working in unison. I will use R coding language to organize my data, find correlations, and visualize trends that I find through my research.
